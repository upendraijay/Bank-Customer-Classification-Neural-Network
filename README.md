# Bank-Customer-Classification-Neural-Network

It is no secret that customer retention is a top priority for many companies, acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than retaining existing ones. A churn model can predict - which customers will be leaving the bank.

In this dataset, we have to consider which of the factors may play a role in someone exiting a bank. To do that we must look at all the column and infer whether it will matter in classifying a new customer or not. The information about a customer is entailed in columns 0 through 12 (RowNumber-EstimatedSalary), while the output (whether the customer exited or not) is stored in the 13th row (Exited). Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

-a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) -b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) -c) perimeter -d) area -e) smoothness (local variation in radius le

The label associated with each record contains the letter "1" if customer Leaves and "M" if 0 if customer stays.
